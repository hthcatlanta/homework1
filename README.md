## Lessons Learned
Be careful of directory structure of local repo. Just because your can render on live server does not mean you can publish. Fixing this error after having a working solving required me to redo the work because I deleted the wrong directory with the right code.

Create a small test bed to work on syntax problems. 

Ask for help early and often.

Sometimes too much knowledge is worse not not enough. Googling problems can and will allow you to enter a rabbit hole if you let it. Step away from the Internet and reassess what the problem is you are trying to solve.
